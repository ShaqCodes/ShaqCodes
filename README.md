Hey, I'm Shaq! 👋
I'm a Computer Science student diving into coding with about 4 months of experience. I’m passionate about web development and enjoy building cool stuff with HTML, CSS, React, and Next.js. Right now, I’m working on a project called Layaway-Solution, a tool to help jewelers manage layaways. 💎

What’s Next? 🚀
I’m excited to explore AI and Machine Learning soon! While I haven’t had the chance to collaborate on projects yet, I’m open to teaming up with others in the future.

A Bit About Me 🥋
When I'm not coding, you’ll find me boxing, practicing martial arts, hitting the gym, or focusing on self-improvement. One of my favorite quotes is from Seneca: "We suffer more in imagination than in reality." 🧠

Let’s Connect! 🤝
I’m always up for connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts and learning from each other. Feel free to drop by, say hi, and see where our interests align!
